          <h3>Early years, Into the Half Moon (1999–2001)</h3>
          <p>
            10 Years were initially formed in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1999 with
            singer Mike Underdown, drummer Brian Vodinh, bassist Lewis Cosby,
            and guitarists Ryan Johnson and Matt Wantland. In 2001, Cosby left
            and the band recruited Andy Parks on bass. They independently
            recorded Into the Half Moon the same year

          <h3>Killing All That Holds You, The Autumn Effect (2002–2006)</h3>
          <p>
            Lead vocalist Mike Underdown left the band to pursue a career in
            acting and start up a new band, Courage, You Bastards, in Los
            Angeles, California. 10 Years soon recruited current vocalist Jesse
            Hasek from another local band. In 2002, Parks decided to leave the
            band and Cosby returned. The band then released their independent
            album Killing All That Holds You in 2004.[2] 10 Years were then
            signed to Universal Records in 2005 and released their major label
            debut, The Autumn Effect on August 16, 2005 with the songs
            "Wasteland" and "Through the Iris" picking up regional radio play.
            Their first single, "Wasteland", spent over 12 months on the rock
            charts, finally reaching No. 1 at active rock radio in December
            2005. That same summer, the band toured with Disturbed and Ill Niño.
            In the fall of 2005, they toured with Breaking Benjamin and Smile
            Empty Soul, then followed up with the Masters of Horror tour with
            Mudvayne and Sevendust. They opened for Korn and Mudvayne on Korn's
            See You on the Other Side tour. They also toured with Korn and

            In mid-February 2006, "Wasteland" reached No. 1 on the Billboard
            Alternative Songs chart.[3] In mid-2006, the band toured Australia

            first music video, "Wasteland", addresses the social problem of
            human rights as well as addiction around the world. The video
            received a nomination for Best Direction and Best Art Direction at
            the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, but did not win either. On March
            27, 2006, an EP was released on iTunes containing acoustic versions
            of "Wasteland", "Prey", "Through The Iris" and "Faultline" from The
            Autumn Effect.[5] As of December 2017, The Autumn Effect and its
            breakthrough single, "Wasteland",[1] have been certified Gold by the

            later on January 29, 2008, "Beautiful", the new single from
            Division, was released to iTunes and a snippet was also posted on
            the band's MySpace page. Division was released on May 13, 2008 after
